so many different [topics], from poetry to ethics, to finance, to how to train medical students, to the arts, so it seems to hold a lot of things together â€“ but it does seem maybe interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary.From my very limited understanding I think one of the goals would be to help medical students and medical practitioners act in more â€“ in less mechanical ways, more humane ways; so maybe ultimately the goal is to produce medical practitioners that are moreâ€¦ that listen better, that have more of an understanding of the whole person.VHÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Thinking about it in those broadish terms, do you think that there is any particular value for this kind of work relating to South Africa, or to southern Africa more generally?AdSÂ Â Â Â  You know, yesterday there was an interview on CNN with somebody whoâ€™d worked with ebola; I was listening more with a research methodology hat on but maybe it applies here as well: you can have all the medical knowledge in the world, but if a community doesnâ€™t trust you, the information youâ€™re giving them about how to manage the body of your deceased loved one â€“ theyâ€™re not going to listen to you.\n","He sayâ€™s â€œAlways aim at getting the results wherever u find yourselfâ€.SHORT PROFILE:Demilade is a man of many parts â€“ trained petroleum engineer, health systems consultant by day, writer by night, project manager by practice, and drummer by weekend.Heâ€™s worked as the associate editor of over 5 magazines and online platforms reaching audience in over 40 countries.In his current role, he led a project that provided HIV testing for over 420, 000 people and put over 2,000 people living with HIV on life saving anti-retroviral therapy across FCT, Benue and Nasarawa state.\n","It has held six successful elections since the 1992 end of military rule.Its economy has also been strong in recent years, with 14% growth in 2011 and some eight percent in 2012.But Gates and others point out that one of the real secrets of its success has been the way its health service is organised, with efficient community health centres that conduct outreach to ensure as many babies are vaccinated as possible.Subscribe to the Africa Research Bulletin today\n","As a participant you will have the opportunity to learn how to use the limited resources at your disposal to deliver health care at all times.Â One of the questions asked most by participants who want to take part in our programs is of how a typical day with Elective Africa healthcare internships is like.\n","In the case of South Africa, it is clear that the ideal health professional â€˜fit for purposeâ€™, and ready to deliver health services as proposed by Health Plan 2030, needs to use their hearts and their heads to bridge the different chasms between theory and practice, between disease and the patients experience of illness and lastly between the body as object that needs fixing and the person as subject of our care and intervention focus.\n","So I think that bridges that gap.VHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thereâ€™s a long history â€“ particularly in this country, of the use of theatre in that way, in medical education; but I suppose the issue is that itâ€™s not mainstreamed; it comes down to the initiative of a particular clinic, doctor â€“EPÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Itâ€™s targeted niches, or targeted schools, because not all schools have the privilege of having people coming to perform.\n","Over the next several days, thousands of Rotarians and partners rolled up their sleeves to work together, resultingÂ in the provision of diseaseÂ prevention and treatment services to over 66,500 folks in need.TheÂ power of these partnerships, which includedÂ the South Africa Department of Health taking full responsibility for follow up on referrals, is what makes RFHDs such an excellent model for high impact, measurable and sustainable interventions.As Rotary continues to explore models for projects that provide large, measurable impacts and are sustainable, we have in our â€˜front yardâ€™ a living, evolving masterpiece.\n","Itâ€™s very difficult to change their beliefs because this is what they have believed since they were born,â€ he says.The government has enforced security in affected areas, but many feel that it should have taken a stauncher response, reassuring those who felt threatened by the wave of violence.â€œAs a country I think weâ€™re very ashamed,â€ says Dr Nyaka, adding that the Malawi Society of Medical Doctors â€œwill take this as a challenge to communicate to our people and to reassure them that they are not blood suckers.â€Malawi will from November 1st host a three-day high-level meeting on promoting policy coherence on health technology innovation and access for the African Regional Intellectual Property Office (ARIPO), said Malawi News Agency.The meeting brings together a range of leaders, policymakers and institutions including representatives from Ministries of Trade, Health and Justice, civil society, international experts and academics.Minister of Health Atupele Muluzi has said Malawi and many of the 18 ARIPO member states have made great strides in improving public health and by consequence, human development outcomes in recent years.He said that despite significant progress, the burden of infectious diseases, particularly HIV, malaria and Tuberculosis pose a threat to public health.Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, Samuel Tembenu said the meeting comes at a time when countries around the world are pursuing various means to ensure availability and access to medicines for their citizens.The meeting aims at providing a forum for ARIPO countries to exchange views and to share experiences on best practices that promote availability and access to affordable health coverage, Tembenu added.The high-level meeting has been jointly organised by the Malawi government and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).Find out more in the Africa Research Bulletin:Malawi â€“ Refugee Clashes DeploredPolitical, Social and Cultural series\n","More than 90% of Rwandans are now covered under the community-based health insurance scheme known as Mutuelle de SantÃ©, reports The East African.It becomes one of the few developing countries that have successfully achieved universal healthcare.Following problems in recent years with low real uptake numbers and poor service delivery, the government transferred management of the scheme to the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB).According to the Ministry of Health, management of the scheme has improved since it was moved to RSSB in 2015, but some citizens say the quality of services is still wanting.â€œIt is not easy to secure a transfer from a district hospital if you need to go to a referral hospital,â€ says Sarafina Mukasarasi, 40, a card holder, though she says services at the district hospitals have improved, despite the long queues.Mukasarasi however says that thanks to the insurance scheme, for which she pays about $3.36 (Rwf3,000) a year based on her household income, she does not pay a single penny when she falls ill or gives birth.The scheme has been touted as one of the most successful on the continent and is credited for the countryâ€™s lower maternal and infant mortality rates of 77% and 70%, respectively, since 2000.In November, experts had called for proactive measures to achieve universal healthcare coverage in order to reverse the trend whereby millions of people are pushed into extreme poverty by unaffordable healthcare.Some of the main challenges are non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease, which are costly to treat, according to a report by The New Times.Â Maternal and child health are the main areas to be covered in Kenyaâ€™s new pilot programme.\n","Or was that during the [HIV/AIDS] crisis?DALÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah, but also more generally the greater emphasis on primary healthcare â€¦ in informal settlements around Khayelitsha in Cape Town â€“ the outreach dimensions, the social health dimensions, and even practical things like going into ECD [Early Childhood Development] facilities for preventive medicine screening, inoculation, all those kinds of things â€“ a lot of thatâ€™s fallen apart since the clinic structure has improved; which means that the networks, social relations, are also less; and itâ€™s a deeply moralistic space.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YT1adlqglAUb","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":126},"outputId":"16cd7412-e6df-4a8f-ea3a-88cd1bf9371f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1575172187590,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":4762,"user":{"displayName":"Pooja
